Compliling:
	Type make.
	
Implementation/Bugs:
	To use the map file we found we had to seperarate most of it's parts into individual obj files in order to 
	properly render them from back to front.
	We also did not have enough time to do bounds for the whole map.
	We attempted to do md5 stuff for animation, but since we couldn't export our model in MD5 we opted to hack it with many obj files
	
Input file format:
	No file inputs

	Lake	: attempted MD5 loading + rendering, Flashlight and moonlight
	Matt	: Loading + texturing of map, rendering of map, movement
