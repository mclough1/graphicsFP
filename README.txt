Description:
This is a game where you play as a snowman and you need to knock all the enemies off your iceberg by running
into them, watch out however because when you hit them they hit you!

Compiling:
Might need to change the paths in the makefile, but just run the make command and run the executable.
This program depends on various util files that Dr. Paone provided in previous assignments including: 
	objects3.hpp
	ShaderProgram3.hpp
	TextureUtils.hpp

Playing: 
Use wasd keys to move the character
The default camera location is the reccomended camera location since it lines up with the directional movement, 
but technically it is an arcball around 0,0,0

control+click and drag to zoom in and out (if you dare)

Q/ESC exits

Bugs:
sometimes the player might get stuck in an enemy


This assignment took me 10 hrs I think
The lab helped quite a bit 7; I used lab 11 as a starter
The assignment was fun, I just did not have the time to put into it 8
